## Description
Edgy name but not as cool as *PissHooksâ„¢* (RIP).

As I said I made this project to learn about game hacking and cpp in general, so expect some bad practises and errors, but feel free to improve them!

See [contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing to the project and [references.md](REFERENCES.md) for a list of cheats that helped me learn while making it.

## Installing
### Compiling from source (Recommended)
I recommend using Visual Studio 2022.

1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 from [this link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
2. [Clone](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) or [download](https://github.com/r4v10l1/NullHooks/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the project to your computer
3. Open the file `src/csgo-cheat.sln` with Visual Studio 2022
4. If an alert pops up, click `Ok` or `Update`, if it doesn't make sure the project is updated by clicking `Project > Retarget solution` in the window bar
5. Make sure you are compiling the project in `Release | x86` in the top bar
6. Click `Build > Build solution` in the window bar (You can also press `Ctrl+Shift+B`)
7. The final `.dll` file path should be in the output window of Visual Studio (Usually `src/output/release/csgo-cheat.dll`)
8. Inject using your favourite [injector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection)

*Note: If you have problems, make sure you follow the steps above and verify the integrity of your game files.*

### Downloading the `.dll` from releases
This method is not recommended as the cheat can be a bit outdated and you might encounter some problems depending on your computer.

1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/r4v10l1/NullHooks/releases/latest)
2. Download the file `csgo-cheat.dll` under "Assets"
3. Inject using your favourite [injector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection)
